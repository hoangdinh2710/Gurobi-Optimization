# Optimization
Use Gurobi to solve linear programming problem

## Introduction

We use Gurobi to solve the problem proposed by Katja Buhrkal, Allan Larsen and Stefan Ropke in their paper:"The waste collection vehicle routing problem with time windowns in a city logistics context". 

## Objective

We need to come up with a solution to collect the waste efficently. Intuiatively, the trucks must start from a depot, collect trash from individual homes, dump the trash at the disposal sites and then will come back to the depot. The solution must provide routes for each trucks which minize the transportation costs given certain contraints.
